# Simple Localization Fixes
a simple text replacement mod to fix grammatical/spelling errors in persona 4 golden

open an issue to submit fixes (and be SURE to indicate which event/field script file its in, if you can!)


## how it started
chie forgot a word when talking to yosuke and narukami during my playthrough (regarding yukiko on the midnight channel). it bugged me so much im making this
## is it compatible with [insert text mod here]
SHOULD work with other text mods (the cheat sheets, the two naoto related mods, yosuke and kanji romances, etc.) unless we edit the same event/field scripts. if that happens let me know and i'll try to create something compatible.
